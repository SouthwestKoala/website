I want you to feel at home when you post a comment on this site. I want everyone to feel at home posting comments on this site. I don’t know what your home is like, but I know how I expect people to behave when they visit mine. That’s why I reserve the right to delete comments and ban users as needed to keep the comment threads here civil and substantive.
