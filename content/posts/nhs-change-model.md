The [NHS Change Model](https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/the-change-model-guide/) is framework for projects and programmes that aim to achieve transformational, sustainable change.

All too often, projects are focused on specific changes - whether introducing new or modifying existing processes - rather than the larger system in which the changes will happen. Whilst it is certainly possible that this can deliver transformational and sustainable change, it is not gaurenteed. 

It is estimated that only 30% of projects deliver change is some way, whilst only 5% achieve or exceed their aims. A better approach is to consider the whole from the start.

One needs to ask the question, "why are we doing this?"
